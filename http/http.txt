Difference between HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2

HTTP1.1 HTTP is a top level application protocol that exchanges informations between a client computer and a local or remote web server. in this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POSt.
HTTP1.1 requires the downloading of multiple streams in parallel because it can handle only one request at the time.
HTTP2 began as the SPDY protocol,developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency
HTTP2 allows for faster transmission between servers and computer.
